PropellerIDE Linux Installation

The PropellerIDE is designed for building Propeller Spin/PASM programs.
PropellerIDE is distributed for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

Linux Packaging:

Linux packages are primitive at the moment and will be changed to use the
typical packager tools for the platform. The current package includes a
setup script and supporting shared libraries. If you are missing items from
the system required by PropellerIDE you can use the ldd tool to find out what
you need, I.E. $ ldd /opt/propelleride/bin/PropellerIDE

Debian packages are known to work on Ubuntu.

In the instruction below PropellerIDE-packagename.bz2 refers to the package
such as PropellerIDE-1-0-i686-linux.bz2. PropellerIDE-version refers to the
PropellerIDE version such as PropellerIDE-1-0.

Please note the $ sign is a standard symbol for a command prompt in Linux.
If you see "$ command", it means enter command in your command terminal window.


The general Linux install and run procedures are::

INSTALL

  1. Unpack PropellerIDE with the linux distribution's archive tool or
     $ tar -xjf PropellerIDE-packagename.bz2

  2. Change directory $ cd PropellerIDE-version.

  3. Setup with $ sudo ./setup.sh (or use root $ ./setup.sh)
   a. The setup.sh can also remove PropellerIDE with sudo ./setup.sh remove
   b. Note that setup.sh will add /usr/bin/propelleride and /opt/propelleride.

  4. PropellerIDE workspace:
   a. Spin library files are saved in /opt/propelleride/spin
   b. Demos or other files to be edited must be copied from there to a p

  5. For the installer will remove this property file:
   ~/.config/ParallaxInc/PropellerIDE.conf file.

  6. Users may add a shortcut to /usr/bin/propelleride on the desktop for easy access.

RUN

  1. From any directory, run with the command $ propelleride
   a. Do not use $ ./propelleride; it will not work.
   b. Typing $ propelleride starts /usr/bin/propelleride which properly sets the environment.
   c. Alternatively use $ propelleride & (makes the program run in the background).

  2. Typical PropellerIDE Properties will have:
   a. Spin Compiler: /opt/propelleride/bin/openspin
   b. Library: /opt/propelleride/spin

  3. The PropellerIDE program should start with: /opt/parallax/spin/Welcome.spin
